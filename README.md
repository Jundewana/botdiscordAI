# botdiscordAI
Hello, this discord bot is JS node based. Before using it please install discord.js and openai.js. After that do:
1. https://discord.com/developers/applications create and add bots to own server. Then Generate the token and enter it in bot.js in the token section
2. Enter https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to get api keys and enter the key in the ai.js code.
3. Also enter the organization id which can be found at: https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings
4. Run the bot and start the question with the command '!'.
Example : !explain why you are okay.
Note: api from open AI can only be used for free in the first 3 months, so if the account used is more than 3 months then the solution is to create a new account with a new number (This bot was created only to learn how to implement nodejs on Discord)
